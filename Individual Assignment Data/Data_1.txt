You probably worked out that a backslash means that the following character is deprived of its special powers and must literally match a specific character in the word. Thus, while . is special, \. only matches a period. The braced expressions, like {3,5}, specify the number of repeats of the previous item. The pipe character indicates a choice between the material on its left or its right. Parentheses indicate the scope of an operator: they can be used together with the pipe (or disjunction) symbol like this: «w(i|e|ai|oo)t», matching wit, wet, wait, and woot. It is instructive to see what happens when you omit the parentheses from the last expression above.
